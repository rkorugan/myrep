DB2PY tool is developed to automate the SQL query performance analysis process. 
This tool will parse the entire stored procedure to identify the SQLs and generate a report showing   the execution plan 
and cost of each query used in the stored procedure. The reports will be stored in   Jenkins workspace.
This will greatly reduce the developers time in analysing the queries for optimized performance.
